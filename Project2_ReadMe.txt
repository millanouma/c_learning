In the lesson on strings, you learned about the strcpy() function that is used to copy one string into another string. Recall that strcpy() requires two strings: one source string and one destination string. It will copy the contents of the source string into the destination string.

In this project, you will increase your understanding of this function by implementing its functionality. You will see how strcpy() works “under the hood.”

In your code, you will implement the strcpy() functionality inside the copy() function. You will do this by using your knowledge about pointers.

Recall that a string is an array of type char. Also, recall that an array can be traversed using a pointer. A pointer to an array (or string) initially points to the first element (or character) in the array (string).

The concept of a function will be covered in a later lesson, so don’t worry too much about the details of how a function works. For now, just think of a function as a way to neatly organize your code.

Inside the copy() function, the char pointer src is pointing to the address of the first character in the source string, and the dst pointer is pointing to the first character of the destination string.
